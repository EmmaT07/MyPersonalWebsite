    <h1>Proposal for Term Project by Emma</h1>
    <p>
      I will create a website about Quartz wholesale. The objective of this
      website is to attract quartz retailers to know more about the company and
      browse the products. My father has a quartz company so I want to utilize
      his product information to create my personal website. My target audience
      are the retailers in the US. In this website, I am going to include
      company description (I will not just copy paste from the company, I will
      make something up) in the home page, a product page that includes some of
      the product information and pictures, a page expalining why people should
      choose quartz. I will also create a contact me page for future connection
      with customers.
